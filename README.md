# Increased peak detection accuracy in over-dispersed ChIP-seq data with supervised segmentation models

**Motivation:** Histone modification constitutes a basic mechanism for the genetic regulation of gene expression. In early 2000s, a powerful technique has emerged that couples chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). This technique provides a direct survey of the DNA regions associated to these modifications. In order to realize the full potential of this technique, increasingly sophisticated statistical algorithms have been developed or adapted to analyze the massive amount of data generated by it. Many of these algorithms were built around natural assumptions like the Poisson one for modeling the noise in the count data. In this work we depart from these natural assumptions and show that it is possible to improve upon them.

**Results:** The results of our comparisons on two reference datasets of histone modifications (H3K36me3 \& H3K4me3) suggest that natural assumptions are not always realistic in application conditions. We show that the unconstrained multiple changepoint detection model with alternative noise models and a suitable setup provides a better fit to the count data and turn out to detect peaks more accurately than algorithms which rely on these natural assumptions.
